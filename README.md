# Welcome to my boilerplate!

The following is included in this template repo:
* Express & Node as backend.
  * TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier are set up
* React as frontend framework
  * Also has TypeScript set up
* MongoDB (to be added)

Because I'm too cheap to pay to deploy this app, please do the following to see the app run locally!
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into the /api folder
3. Run `npm run start`
4. cd into the /client folder
5. Open another terminal and run `yarn start`
6. Voila!
